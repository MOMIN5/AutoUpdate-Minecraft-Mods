Change the pastebin link with yours check pastebin template for more info   
then change your mod url with yours, make sure its a direct link(ends with .jar)
If the version in the pastebin doesnt match the one in MainClass.VERSION, it will try to download the mod and save it to the desktop
Then you can replace it in your mod folders   

Make sure you change the VERSION String in your updated version or else it will be stuck in an endless loop

The String in the paste is seperated by '=', you can put anything before '=', However after it you will need to enter your version name    
Version names matter so choose them wisely!
